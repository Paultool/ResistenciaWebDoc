WEBVTT

cue-1
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.871
Tuxtla, dad.

cue-2
00:00:02.871 --> 00:00:03.499
Ñippi.

cue-3
00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:07.803
Pachuca and Hidalgo, from the Huasteca and
Hidalguense.

cue-4
00:00:07.803 --> 00:00:08.520
Hell yeah!

cue-5
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.422
Drinking pulque, my own.

cue-6
00:00:10.422 --> 00:00:13.720
Just this, because there's no more,
otherwise, otherwise

cue-7
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.307
[laughs] we'd have another.

cue-8
00:00:15.307 --> 00:00:17.687
I went, I deserted, because I don't like,

cue-9
00:00:17.687 --> 00:00:18.420
I don't like

cue-10
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.172
killing another bastard. I will never accept it.

cue-11
00:00:21.172 --> 00:00:23.740
They will never-- I don't have to accept

cue-12
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.642
taking the life of a human being.

cue-13
00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:29.614
I am class of 1979. You know?

cue-14
00:00:29.614 --> 00:00:31.340
And I didn't accept many

cue-15
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.150
things because not-- Ideology,

cue-16
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.520
whatever you want. I respect the guy

cue-17
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.200
for who he is,

cue-18
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.262
for what he achieved.

cue-19
00:00:39.262 --> 00:00:40.974
But in the Acteal massacre,

cue-20
00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:43.040
I know he fulfilled his duty,

cue-21
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.287
because all of us,

cue-22
00:00:44.287 --> 00:00:46.295
because they all dictate to us there.

cue-23
00:00:46.295 --> 00:00:48.650
I didn't want to jump out of a Hercules,

cue-24
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.626
as he said.

cue-25
00:00:49.626 --> 00:00:52.291
Hercules, Arava, the Koski, C-130.

cue-26
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:54.880
To kill people. I didn't enlist

cue-27
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.563
for that. That's why I deserted,

cue-28
00:00:56.563 --> 00:00:59.480
because I know my conscience will never be at peace.

cue-29
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.310
You know? I respect him for who he is, for
what he's going to do.

cue-30
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.960
And look, I acknowledge it like this, I acknowledge it like this.

cue-31
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.820
I was discharged with a dishonorable

cue-32
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.380
discharge, I don't care.

cue-33
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.140
Class of '79.

cue-34
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.170
Here I go on the plane, look, so that--

cue-35
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.463
Wait, wait.

cue-36
00:01:19.463 --> 00:01:24.100
All of us who entered and graduated were few. There are already

cue-37
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.820
only a few photos that, that I have left.

cue-38
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.620
No, this...

cue-39
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.005
I only live on memories now. Seniority.

cue-40
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:46.480
You live on memories?

cue-41
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.515
136 seniority and my wings.

cue-42
00:01:48.515 --> 00:01:51.002
Well, I even have them tattooed,

cue-43
00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:52.510
right? But actually,

cue-44
01:52.510 --> 01:57.780
actually, these are the ones you graduate with,

cue-45
01:57.780 --> 01:59.307
with five jumps.

cue-46
01:59.307 --> 01:59.815
Ohhh.

cue-47
01:59.815 --> 02:04.480
And when you do thirty jumps, they give you a

cue-48
02:04.480 --> 02:05.483
star.

cue-49
02:05.483 --> 02:05.984
Uh-huh.

cue-50
02:05.984 --> 02:11.300
And when you do more than a hundred
jumps, a star and a laurel.

cue-51
02:11.300 --> 02:13.440
Do you have any of those decorations?

cue-52
02:14.200 --> 02:16.667
No. I didn't reach thirty jumps.

cue-53
02:16.667 --> 02:17.352
I was short.

cue-54
02:17.352 --> 02:19.544
They are many, right? I imagine.

cue-55
02:19.544 --> 02:19.750
Yes,

cue-56
02:19.750 --> 02:20.895
yes, they are many.

cue-57
02:20.895 --> 02:23.400
And each jump, you're forging them. I mean,

cue-58
02:24.580 --> 02:29.460
you must have very good fitness and know
how to dominate your parachute, know how to execute your

cue-59
02:29.460 --> 02:35.320
fall. Five points of contact. That is,
tip (toes), calves, buttocks and

cue-60
02:35.320 --> 02:37.980
back.

cue-61
02:40.020 --> 02:41.998
Five points of contact.

cue-62
02:41.998 --> 02:43.580
Yes, for the mission.

cue-63
02:45.720 --> 02:49.540
And to drink pulque, how many points of
contact do you need to complete that

cue-64
02:49.540 --> 02:49.993
mission?

cue-65
02:49.993 --> 02:51.198
To be here already having breakfast.

cue-66
02:51.198 --> 02:53.098
Yes, in the morning, I ate my chilaquiles

cue-67
02:53.098 --> 02:53.840
which cost me

cue-68
02:53.840 --> 02:55.512
forty pesos, very tasty, by the way,

cue-69
02:55.512 --> 02:56.269
here on the Boulevard,

cue-70
02:59.620 --> 03:03.618
and I said: "Well, I'm going to pair it with a little beer,"

cue-71
03:03.618 --> 03:04.460
I had one,

cue-72
03:04.460 --> 03:05.070
a beer.

cue-73
03:05.680 --> 03:07.870
But I pour myself a glass and I am

cue-74
03:08.500 --> 03:10.522
doing chores, you know what I mean?

cue-75
03:10.522 --> 03:12.880
I mean, in movement. Right now, one said, I'll

cue-76
03:12.880 --> 03:15.600
relax for a while. And this,

cue-77
03:17.160 --> 03:19.520
it's just the time for the fashion show

cue-78
03:20.420 --> 03:20.430
.

cue-79
03:22.780 --> 03:29.700
In 1993, I enlisted on October 1,
1993. Ninety-

cue-80
03:29.700 --> 03:34.280
three, ninety-four, ninety-five,
ninety-six, and in ninety-seven. I

cue-81
03:34.280 --> 03:35.880
failed universal history.

cue-82
03:37.680 --> 03:38.200
I couldn't

cue-83
03:38.820 --> 03:41.720
handle the subject. There, you only have

cue-84
03:42.400 --> 03:47.819
eight, barely passing, nine, regular, and ten,
excellent, honor roll. I got, I think,

cue-85
03:47.819 --> 03:48.820
six point five, I didn't even reach seven.

cue-86
03:48.820 --> 03:52.300
I got, I think, six point five, I didn't even reach seven.

cue-87
03:53.920 --> 03:59.200
They sent me back to the Air Force
command and my general told me: "You were

cue-88
03:59.200 --> 04:03.180
already a cadet, you were going to be a mechanic,
a mechanic, damn it. Now are you going to

cue-89
04:03.180 --> 04:07.460
return as an enlisted soldier again?
Do you want your papers or are you going to

cue-90
04:07.460 --> 04:10.120
bust your ass?" "No, just give me my papers."

cue-91
04:10.120 --> 04:11.515
He gave me my papers, here you go.

cue-92
04:11.515 --> 04:12.780
Get the hell out of here.

cue-93
04:12.780 --> 04:17.860
I cried like you wouldn't believe, I went
to the ranch,

cue-94
04:18.480 --> 04:25.240
to the Cerro del Chilelete. At that time,
my dad had a cabin on the avenue. And

cue-95
04:25.240 --> 04:27.520
I went to lock myself up there, I went on a strike of,

cue-96
04:28.240 --> 04:29.310
I went on a hunger strike.

cue-97
04:29.980 --> 04:33.840
I didn't want to know anything because I felt
like a total badass

cue-98
04:34.440 --> 04:35.580
and suddenly they,

cue-99
04:36.360 --> 04:40.760
they kick me in the butt. Well, they didn't,
but rather

cue-100
04:41.360 --> 04:43.900
I didn't take advantage of the studies.

cue-101
04:45.140 --> 04:48.539
And yes, my uncle found me because they were
looking for me: "Hey, Omar is missing, he's

cue-102
04:48.540 --> 04:50.980
missing, we already went there and...

cue-103
04:51.980 --> 04:56.490
He's missing, my boy, haven't you seen him?"
Well, he really liked it here.

cue-104
04:56.490 --> 05:01.260
"I heard noises in the cabin, he must
be in the cabin." "And yes, they go to

cue-105
05:01.260 --> 05:06.500
the cabin and they find me. And they
start motivating me, right?" My uncle Ángel,

cue-106
05:06.500 --> 05:08.620
the wrestler, my uncle, the

cue-107
05:09.660 --> 05:10.420
driver.

cue-108
05:11.640 --> 05:14.960
"Ah, well, if the president didn't have to
be in the Armed Forces and he is

cue-109
05:14.960 --> 05:20.160
president." They motivated me. Ah, what can
I say? Well, let's go, then. Let's go for

cue-110
05:20.160 --> 05:20.900
barbecue.

cue-111
05:21.900 --> 05:23.420
They took me, they took me to

cue-112
05:24.500 --> 05:29.860
eat, my dad brought me back here, to
Mexico. And I take it and I say to my

cue-113
05:29.860 --> 05:34.376
mom: "Mom, tomorrow I'm going to the United
States."

cue-114
05:34.376 --> 05:35.460
"Oh, son.

cue-115
05:36.140 --> 05:40.020
Your son again." Well, I'm done...
"Yes, son," she said.

cue-116
05:40.700 --> 05:44.920
"Well, go on then, have a safe trip."
As if he were going to... Right? As if

cue-117
05:44.920 --> 05:50.780
he were going to Tlalnepantla. "Oh, son,
you don't know what you're saying." Oh, mother.

cue-118
05:51.500 --> 05:52.880
Well, Mexican Army,

cue-119
05:54.660 --> 05:59.230
I go to say goodbye to my, to my
comrades and the next day, early, at

cue-120
05:59.230 --> 06:05.859
seven in the morning, with two changes of
clothes, one on and two to, spares.

cue-121
06:06.640 --> 06:11.210
Hitchhiking, hitchhiking, hitchhiking, hitchhiking.

cue-124
06:11.210 --> 06:13.020
And I worked, I helped the people who

cue-125
06:13.740 --> 06:16.896
gave me a ride. They gave me my change.

cue-126
06:16.896 --> 06:20.700
Ah, if I liked a state, I bought a bag

cue-127
06:20.700 --> 06:26.400
of candies and sold the candies on the
buses. Until I reached Ciudad

cue-128
06:26.400 --> 06:29.840
Juárez. Ah, a huge adventure

cue-129
06:31.039 --> 06:32.640
that I cross the Rio Grande

cue-130
06:34.479 --> 06:41.479
and I arrive in Texas. A huge adventure.
I call them. I'm in Texas. You damn "compadre,"

cue-131
06:41.479 --> 06:47.080
you damn "compadre," no way, you're a
badass, you didn't even pay a coyote. I didn't pay

cue-132
06:47.080 --> 06:52.180
anything, I crossed it all by myself.

cue-133
06:54.099 --> 06:59.140
And I worked there for two months in a hotel.
I couldn't go out because there were no permits.

cue-134
06:59.140 --> 07:05.099
I mean, since I was an immigrant, I was
under the radar, without papers. They

cue-135
07:05.099 --> 07:07.560
kept me...

cue-136
07:08.200 --> 07:08.680
I mean,

cue-137
07:09.940 --> 07:16.020
I maintained the hotel, mopped, swept,
the pool, whatever the... told me.

cue-138
07:16.020 --> 07:20.580
But I couldn't go out. He would send for
my pizzas or whatever food I wanted.

cue-139
07:20.580 --> 07:24.719
Why? So the immigration police wouldn't
catch me. And guess what? I decided

cue-140
07:24.719 --> 07:28.440
to go to Chicago, Illinois.

cue-141
07:32.380 --> 07:35.811
I was doing well. The hotel guy even took
me there, but he did tell me:

cue-142
07:35.811 --> 07:36.719
"I'll just drop you off here,

cue-143
07:36.719 --> 07:41.960
and then I'm leaving." Perfect. Well, upon
getting the ticket

cue-144
07:41.960 --> 07:44.179
for...

cue-145
07:45.320 --> 07:50.900
The ticket for Chicago, Illinois, the
immigration police were there. ID, your papers,

cue-146
07:50.900 --> 07:57.360
paper. You're going back. And they

cue-147
07:57.360 --> 08:02.240
send me back. But they did give me back my ticket,
my five hundred dollars, they

cue-148
08:02.240 --> 08:08.099
gave me back the plane ticket money and I
had another five hundred, I had a thousand dollars. And I

cue-149
08:08.099 --> 08:14.200
go to Mexico, they send me back. But I arrived
in the state of Guanajuato. I remember

cue-150
08:14.200 --> 08:17.580
I even bought a piece of land and fell
in love with a girl and oh no, no, no.

cue-151
08:18.559 --> 08:23.860
But her boyfriend arrives from the US with
a truck and some damn huge speakers.

cue-152
08:24.380 --> 08:29.659
Well, I feel like it. No, well my girlfriend
sends me away. No, well you can imagine that

cue-153
08:29.659 --> 08:31.617
it turned into a mess. And well.

cue-154
08:31.617 --> 08:34.780
The most beautiful thing that has happened to
me in life

cue-155
08:35.380 --> 08:39.860
is jumping out of a plane, being in the
Parachute Rifle Brigade

cue-156
08:40.819 --> 08:45.180
and having met the mother of my children.
Four children, two girls and two

cue-157
08:45.180 --> 08:51.339
boys. I am currently a grandfather. She just
turned about three, three years, four

cue-158
08:51.339 --> 08:54.329
years old. Luckily, I haven't gone to

cue-159
08:54.329 --> 08:56.133
visit her.
