WEBVTT

cue-1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760
Stupid damn food, I want a pizza. Look,
uh, [ambulance noise] I'm here

cue-2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.740
with Maritza. Look, I'm laughing my ass
off. We do it well because this is like

cue-3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.120
the breeze when it hits you in the morning.
Look, I'll tell you what I don't do this week. My

cue-4
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:23.060
soul emanates with the rap that I drop. Look,
I go in the Bboy's area. I'm still doing it

cue-5
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.280
today. Look, I'll tell you that I'm here all
the way up, with Edín. Know that I do it

cue-6
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.620
until the end. Look, I'm going to tell you
that I don't fall like Cain. Velázquez, my style,

cue-7
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.960
you get stuck so you can chew it. I'm
Jordan in basketball. Look, ask yourself,

cue-8
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.400
question yourself, delight yourself, meditate.
Look, I'll tell you to recite the style I give you

cue-9
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.940
like a tea. I reconnected it, that's what
I know. It's the MC's art so you can see what's

cue-10
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.880
up. Look, I started since I was thirteen,
sometimes saying nonsense. Look, I used to win

cue-11
00:00:57.880 --> 01:03.560
championships in Cipreses. Here with my
friend I return, I'm the obsessed one, the one who goes overboard

cue-12
01:03.560 --> 01:09.760
with verses. I'm the one who does it in
this universe, I converse with myself. I'm not

cue-13
01:09.760 --> 01:14.200
egocentrism, I'm selfishness in person.
This is rap in the zone.

cue-14
01:15.380 --> 01:16.200
And it continues

cue-15
01:16.820 --> 01:22.600
already, and this is poetry, get rid of
all the bitterness. We come here to speak with

cue-16
01:22.600 --> 01:27.780
sanity. This is the nomenclature, they know
I do it with culture until the

cue-17
01:27.780 --> 01:29.840
grave. It's a literature,

cue-18
01:29.840 --> 01:31.260
that one that is purer

cue-19
01:31.260 --> 01:33.017
like electrocure,

cue-20
01:33.017 --> 01:38.120
look, it always comes hard, that's it. It's
the shade, I'm the slip.

cue-21
01:38.120 --> 01:43.520
Maybe sometimes I cause tears like an
actress, but I come to tell you that like

cue-22
01:43.520 --> 01:50.040
Tarantino, I give you a scare. I am the
Bboy, I do it even in style. Look,

cue-23
01:50.040 --> 01:55.080
I come and live on the edge. They know I
come by a thread. Look, I'll tell you that I come and

cue-24
01:55.080 --> 01:59.460
profile myself with a fine focus
[ambulance noise]. While the beat finishes,

cue-25
01:59.460 --> 02:03.760
I am the activist so you don't resist. I
come in this freestyle, I'm the

cue-26
02:03.760 --> 02:08.840
tightrope walker. They already know that I
don't maneuver, I come to tell you that I don't look down

cue-27
02:08.840 --> 02:13.060
on anyone. I simply give them my hand.
Look, brother, I'll tell you that in this,

cue-28
02:13.060 --> 02:18.740
I change, I transmute, I execute, I'm Lex
Luthor. Maybe in the style that I'll tell you,

cue-29
02:18.740 --> 02:24.160
that I come on the sly, that apprentice that
I always was, that's why I never change. I come

cue-30
02:24.160 --> 02:26.549
to tell you that I never feel like a wise man.

cue-31
02:27.160 --> 02:32.440
I learn at any time. Look, I reflect
on my vocabulary, my mind,

cue-32
02:32.440 --> 02:38.540
my eloquent style, extravagant, sometimes
elegant, sometimes the radiant one.

cue-33
02:38.540 --> 02:44.420
What this mutant does, I come to tell you
that it is always the persistent one among so many

cue-34
02:44.420 --> 02:50.440
people, my rap suddenly does it to be the
most excellent. I seek excellence

cue-35
02:50.440 --> 02:54.100
also with decency. Look, I'm on that
frequency, I don't know if you understand, I am

cue-36
02:55.000 --> 03:00.120
the sequence, I'm the damn science.
I advance, look, I never rest, I'm going to

cue-37
03:00.120 --> 03:05.019
tell you that I've never been meek, I simply
come and exalt everything, I don't walk

cue-38
03:05.020 --> 03:10.380
barefoot, you know I'm not a fake, I come
to tell you that I bear witness, sometimes

cue-39
03:10.380 --> 03:14.840
they even tell me I talk to demons, but
no, I'm in the

cue-40
03:14.840 --> 03:20.300
pandemonium. Look, I come to tell you that
I'm the master of ceremonies in this

cue-41
03:20.300 --> 03:23.071
harmony, who would have thought? That Bidek

cue-42
03:23.071 --> 03:24.959
would live off of the damn poetry.

cue-43
03:24.959 --> 03:26.280
I'm going to tell you it's

cue-44
03:26.280 --> 03:31.700
my journey to do it every damn day, to
be who I am. Look, I'm going to tell you

cue-45
03:31.700 --> 03:36.300
that I do it until this day,
representing myself. Look, I come to tell you

cue-46
03:36.300 --> 03:41.800
that I do it well, my name is Daniel. Look,
I'm going to tell you that I represent the free, I

cue-47
03:41.800 --> 03:46.720
don't represent Mexico as if it were the
PRI, I represent with its culture, with the

cue-48
03:46.720 --> 03:51.660
people who have the sweetness to say
good morning. This is rap, look at the

cue-49
03:51.660 --> 03:57.100
joys that I tell you every damn day while
I pass it to my friend, this

cue-50
03:57.100 --> 04:00.060
is rap so you can fight for what you
achieve.

cue-51
04:01.220 --> 04:03.700
[murmuring]

cue-52
04:03.700 --> 04:09.146
[laughter, background beat]

cue-53
04:09.146 --> 04:11.984
Yeah, like poetry

cue-54
04:12.020 --> 04:18.959
that's how it is, building revolution. I
came to drop some flow, I came accompanied here with

cue-55
04:18.959 --> 04:24.599
my flavor, that's why I have the street
under pressure. Blessed be the

cue-56
04:04:24.600 --> 04:31.440
inspiration here, ah, that she threw to me,
the street embraced me and so now no one

cue-57
04:31.440 --> 04:32.690
raps like me.

cue-58
04:33.900 --> 04:39.720
It's not that I come to imitate, but I
really must be real now, I can't compare myself,

cue-59
04:39.720 --> 04:45.360
that's why I connect every day. Nature
had to guide me now, ah, it

cue-60
04:45.360 --> 04:51.800
had to throw me, gravity holds me, that's
why nature also entertains me.

cue-61
04:51.800 --> 04:58.600
Ah, a lot of worldview, ah, everyone wants
a lot of enlightenment,

cue-62
04:58.600 --> 05:03.520
knowledge, description, how was it that
everything was created, everyone talks about the

cue-63
05:03.520 --> 05:09.500
humanity, how did everything begin. Ah,
well, life is like that, that I would also

cue-64
05:09.500 --> 05:15.599
wonder. Philosophy, the one I would find
here, every day in my

cue-65
05:15.600 --> 05:21.360
line. We don't stop here to improvise,
inside I feel like magic,

cue-66
05:21.360 --> 05:27.440
it starts to conspire with me. It is then
when knowledge begins to intertwine here,

cue-67
05:27.440 --> 05:31.659
well, the good stuff now, but look, it's
like this.

cue-68
05:31.976 --> 05:33.983
Here with my friend "el Botas" (Boots).

cue-69
05:33.983 --> 05:38.356
Yes, this is for the crew, with Miguel, with
Edín. Look, we do it until the

cue-70
05:38.356 --> 05:43.996
end. Yes, look, I'll tell you I'm like the
angel Seraphim. Yes, if I am the

cue-71
05:43.996 --> 05:50.656
synthesis, I am the emphasis, I am the one
who leaves you paralyzed, in the previous

cue-72
05:50.656 --> 05:56.496
analysis. Yes, if there is no crisis.
Rather in this I never declined. I am the

cue-73
05:56.496 --> 06:03.036
style and the shade. I am the planting and
the root. I am the style that comes from the

cue-74
06:03.036 --> 06:09.896
Land of Corn (Tierra de Maíz). Rastafarai
in any zone. This rhythm that comes and

cue-75
06:09.896 --> 06:16.816
excites you. While my friend Luca takes
it, joke. I'm going to tell you I'm Diego

cue-76
06:16.816 --> 06:23.396
Armando Maradona on the field. I'm at my
ease. Look while they serve him in the

cue-77
06:23.396 --> 06:30.056
glass. I come and review here what the
path of my life has been. Rap and hip

cue-78
06:30.056 --> 06:36.535
hop was my only way out. And who would have
thought that I do it cool. Look, I come now with my

cue-79
06:36.536 --> 06:41.656
friends. Look, I'll tell you that I do it
exhibited. I do it live. Look, I'll tell you

cue-80
06:41.656 --> 06:47.676
that to hallucinate, to always arrive here
until the end. To radiate the good

cue-81
06:47.676 --> 06:53.656
vibe. Look, that which balances me like a
Libra. I weigh like fifteen hundred pounds. I

cue-82
06:53.656 --> 07:00.436
am like Ibrahimovic. And I'll tell you that
we do it in the flow. Look, I come with this

cue-83
07:00.436 --> 07:07.256
show. Doing it with the beat, the bembó.
Look, Bidek is coming. Raising the level

cue-84
07:07.256 --> 07:14.256
for everyone. This is rap. I am a
reference. They already know that I always sound

cue-85
07:14.256 --> 07:21.216
excellent. They tell me to moderate my way
of speaking, of living. I tell them to go

cue-86
07:21.216 --> 07:27.796
to hell. This is rap. I am a mess.
Foremost,

cue-87
07:27.796 --> 07:34.256
I have never been a coward. And I pass it to
my sister while we come smoking

cue-88
07:34.256 --> 07:40.616
the whole branch. I am Bob Marley all week
and I like to smoke

cue-89
07:41.375 --> 07:44.216
-marijuana.
-[instrumental music].

cue-90
07:44.216 --> 07:45.736
I smoke marijuana

cue-91
07:47.336 --> 07:54.316
to keep my soul more purified every day.
Well relaxed, at

cue-92
07:54.316 --> 08:01.156
this moment, I keep myself enlightened.
A lot of inspiration. Nature was the one

cue-93
08:01.156 --> 08:08.096
that guided me. So it received me on Mount
Breakfast. It was, it was, it was, it was, it was

cue-94
08:08.096 --> 08:15.096
that to me too, it was that it chose me.
Today I'm still singing here.

cue-95
08:15.096 --> 08:20.736
That's how it is. I gave a lot of anthems
to the neighborhood. They know me as I

cue-96
08:20.736 --> 08:27.736
have started. That's why it has also
awakened me. In this society they can't

cue-97
08:27.736 --> 08:33.236
accept me. I come against this system.
Babylon has to listen to me.

cue-98
08:33.236 --> 08:40.116
That's why when I drop rhymes, they can
censor me. It comes

cue-99
08:40.116 --> 08:42.016
against.

cue-100
08:42.016 --> 08:42.635
Nice! [laughs] Oh!

cue-101
08:44.036 --> 08:51.036
-It sounds really cool.
-It's the first one. Ay! Ye, ye, ye, ye.

cue-102
08:51.036 --> 08:51.136
Ye, ye, ye, ye.
