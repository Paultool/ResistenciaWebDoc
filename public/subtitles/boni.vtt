cue-1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.390
Look, I used to eat raw cactus pads...

cue-3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.901
you just removed the spines.

cue-4
00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:12.840
If you wanted, you wanted some over there...
back in the time when I

cue-5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.700
lived,

cue-6
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.260
you’d kill little birds to eat. Well,
you’d barbecue them or

cue-7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.780
stew them with chili or with whatever you
wanted, if you had it, and if

cue-8
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:35.720
not, you’d just lick your fingers, seeing how tasty
it was. The grasshoppers,

cue-9
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.660
the mourning dove, which one is the dove? The
grasshoppers, man. A mourning dove...

cue-10
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.424
back then we used to say in my town,
I'm from Jilotepec...

cue-11
00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:53.660
from here to Jilotepec.

cue-12
00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.500
Eh, here look at me. All this is the State
of... the State of

cue-13
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.800
Mexico,

cue-14
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.280
the state of Toluca,

cue-15
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.520
I'm from Jilotepec whenever you want to go.

cue-16
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.220
I used to eat nixtamal, raw corn, uh,

cue-17
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.220
no tortillas, nothing like bam, bam,
bam.

cue-18
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.860
And I would go up the hill

cue-19
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.660
when I could, you could bring back firewood and
if not, well you brought nothing. But there,

cue-20
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:39.260
the hardships, the hardships, my friend, well
you guys don't know anymore, here there is

cue-21
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.620
nothing.

cue-22
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.540
There is nothing.

cue-23
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.100
But yes,

cue-24
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:52.040
I remind you, I suffered a hell of a lot. I am
eighty-six years old,

cue-25
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.620
my friend,

cue-26
00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:00.380
or my friends, whoever it is. Two or three or
four, I don't know,

cue-27
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.360
but now if you see me standing, they'd
say: "What about this guy?"

cue-28
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.639
No, this bastard

cue-29
00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.260
is,

cue-30
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.200
is and will be, God willing. That much is true, if God
wills it,

cue-31
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.120
I... If God wills it, I will be as you
are. And if

cue-32
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.100
not, well anyway, my respect to
you all.

cue-33
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:35.040
And you know what? Alfalfa, the
greens (quelites), the... what's it called? The

cue-34
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.227
mallow... we ate all those, and so what,

cue-35
00:02:38.227 --> 00:02:40.841
here you don't eat a damn thing man,

cue-36
00:02:40.841 --> 00:02:41.740
very... all

cue-37
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.360
that stuff I ate. Amaranth greens, the, the
raw cactus, the

cue-38
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.780
raw corn, the, uh, the nixtamal, everything.

cue-39
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.520
I didn't know a damn thing, man. What-- what is the

cue-40
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:06.240
problem, it's just that I'm telling it,
my whole story. And here you have me now,

cue-41
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.400
standing,

cue-42
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.480
sitting, dancing. That suits me! That does.

cue-43
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:25.700
[hums a song]

cue-44
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.800
But if you mess with a girl, it's bad news.

cue-46
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.000
If you mess with a girl, it's bad news,

cue-47
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.580
it has to be.

cue-48
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.580
And none of that

cue-49
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.160
grabbing the... Well, in that time, none
of grabbing the neck, none of grabbing

cue-50
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.160
the... You know, like, uh, like they say,
grabbing the waist and everything, and here.

cue-51
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.500
No, in that time no. You touched her waist
just a little and she would scream

cue-52
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.620
out loud. And there were

cue-53
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.040
girls, girls, I'm talking about girls
of thirty-five, of, of, of

cue-54
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.720
thirty years old, of twenty-eight years old,
little ones, man. There, nothing, in my

cue-55
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.440
town, it's called Jilotepec.

cue-56
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:24.380
It is joined with what is here, the state of
Toluca.

cue-57
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.240
And whenever you want to meet me, I'll be
present.

cue-58
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.740
I don't hide. That, uh,

cue-59
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.600
poor boys,

cue-60
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.860
well, or girls, maybe they are twenty-something
years old, but if they haven't lived life like

cue-61
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:49.040
me... I worked, I cried, I shouted,

cue-62
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.620
I did it all. What? And here I am. And here I am.

cue-63
00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:02.400
And I drank 96 proof alcohol, I threw myself in,
like they say "do you throw yourself in the hole?",

cue-64
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.680
well let's go, man, but you don't die.
And I bought a canteen

cue-65
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.960
to see if I could finish it. I had beer,
I had

cue-66
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.080
96 proof alcohol.

cue-67
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.700
I had Charanda... Well, I finished it,
man.

cue-68
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:29.680
And here I still am, thanks to God. And I
feel really at ease, because-- but

cue-69
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.580
not just because of my own badassery. First
my God and then, afterwards, you

cue-70
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.940
bastards. You guys. And how many years will you
live, Boni, whatever you-- would like

cue-71
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.760
to live? God gives me license. No, well I
think I won't reach

cue-72
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.480
ninety.

cue-73
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:57.440
I won't make it. Why? You know why?
Why, Boni? Because...

cue-74
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.400
Well sometimes I have problems at home,
even though, even though I am

cue-75
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.436
the... Yes, the designated one there, but there are
problems, yes, sometimes. A damn

cue-76
00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:16.096
little anger or something, something, or X things. Then,
drinking my pulque,

cue-77
00:06:16.096 --> 00:06:17.996
that...

cue-78
00:06:17.996 --> 00:06:22.011
do you think this man, this friend,

cue-79
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:24.279
this gentleman,

cue-80
00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:25.433
is...

cue-81
00:06:25.433 --> 00:06:27.207
is or will be?

cue-82
00:06:27.207 --> 00:06:29.096
Or is he?

cue-83
00:06:29.096 --> 00:06:33.455
Do you think that with eighty-six years

cue-84
00:06:33.455 --> 00:06:40.156
completed...? And I have, well, I am going to
complete on the

cue-85
00:06:40.156 --> 00:06:44.916
14th of May, I complete my eighty-seven
years.

cue-86
00:06:44.916 --> 00:06:47.833
And come on bastards here you have me.

cue-87
00:06:47.833 --> 00:06:49.513
And up with the North,

cue-88
00:06:49.513 --> 00:06:51.635
which is also a town, and

cue-89
00:06:51.635 --> 00:06:55.231
up with Cartagena. And cheers, Boni.

cue-90
00:06:55.231 --> 00:06:58.895
And up with Pablito,

cue-91
00:06:58.895 --> 00:07:05.356
and also Toluca.

cue-92
00:07:05.356 --> 00:07:06.876
Why not?

cue-93
00:07:06.876 --> 00:07:13.695
It's the state, uh, Paraje, what. I live there
in El Paraje, friends. Whenever

cue-94
00:07:13.695 --> 00:07:17.316
you want to visit me, well there it is.

cue-95
00:07:17.316 --> 00:07:21.296
I have a little business there.

cue-96
00:07:21.296 --> 00:07:27.275
And we'll have some beers, well, you drink them,
because I don't drink that shit. There

cue-97
00:07:27.275 --> 00:07:32.775
they forbid me and... Just your pulque, right?,
also. Just pulque. I come from here, fucking

cue-98
00:07:32.775 --> 00:07:39.775
great. With Pablito sometimes I am fucking
great. I am with him. I mean, I have more

cue-99
00:07:39.775 --> 00:07:45.916
friendships and I want to be your friends
if you want. And if not, well like the

cue-100
00:07:45.916 --> 00:07:51.027
saying goes, everyone to their own house. I'm leaving
[chuckle].

cue-101
00:07:51.027 --> 00:08:00.917
See you Boni.

cue-102
00:08:00.917 --> 00:08:07.635
How tasty the Neutle is. I bet you're gonna say:
what is that?

cue-103
00:08:07.635 --> 00:08:10.596
It's pulque.

cue-104
00:08:10.596 --> 00:08:11.876
Neutle

cue-105
00:08:11.876 --> 00:08:15.436
means that it is pulque

cue-106
00:08:15.436 --> 00:08:16.855
because back in my Town,

cue-107
00:08:16.855 --> 00:08:19.836
well I used to speak in Otomi

cue-108
00:08:19.836 --> 00:08:25.488
who knows, I don't even remember anymore. Better
leave it there.
