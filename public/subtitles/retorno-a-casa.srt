1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,200
Since I was a child, I felt a strong
attraction to taking apart the devices

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,680
that surrounded me: watches, calculators,
blenders, microwaves, televisions, video games,

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,500
stereos, washing machines, vacuum cleaners.
Nothing escaped my curiosity. Besides, there was

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,759
no one to stop me. My parents worked
almost all day. My brother

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,779
Irving and I [dog barks] had several
caregivers and neighbors who looked after us in

6
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,920
their homes. That's how I met Rosalba,
Ruben (her son, "El Pul"), and Anita, her

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,180
sister. Over the years, my habit of
taking things apart caused me several

8
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,980
problems, scoldings, and anger from
my parents. One day I took apart a wrist

9
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,120
watch. My father forced me to search
for every last screw, something he never achieved.

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,100
They were very difficult to find. The pressure
in my parents' relationship was so

11
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,400
strong that maybe I took everything apart
to understand how things worked

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,320
on the inside. It was as if... by dissecting
the inner workings of objects, I could also

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,840
understand the tensions at home. As I took
things apart, I began to recognize how the

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,320
illusion behind the devices is dismantled.
As a child, I had a toy television

15
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,520
that showed a puppy playing with a ball.
When I opened it,

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,500
I found a strip of paper that told the
story of that dog. Moving in front of

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,500
a grooved screen created the illusion of a
moving image. Over time, I heard a

18
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,140
neighbor's TV had fallen. I suggested
to my mother that we go see her. While she

19
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,520
was chatting with the neighbor, I took on
the task of investigating inside the broken TV,

20
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,460
hoping to find the Spiderman and
Batman strip.

21
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,200
But I only found circuits that are still
with me today, along with my passion for

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,600
cinema. One day, Don Beto, a friend of
my parents and a neighbor exiled from the

23
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,240
Pinochet dictatorship, who worked as an
official at the Politécnico,

24
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:03,600
brought me a radio to repair. I was about
ten years old. I never repaired it, I broke

25
02:00:03,600 --> 00:02:05,580
it, I removed circuits and burned it. I
think that's where my vocation as an

26
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:10,060
engineer was revealed, although in a very
peculiar way. Instead of

27
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,290
building, it seemed my path was to
deconstruct to understand, like a hacker

28
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,120
who deciphers the source code of a system.
Now, after returning home,

29
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,160
maybe I have to repair things alongside
my mother and my brother. Looking for ways

30
02:00:22,160 --> 00:02:26,140
to generate income, I thought of opening a
repair shop and selling second-hand items

31
02:00:26,140 --> 00:02:31,080
and music from my friends, stickers, and
t-shirts in the garage.

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,680
This is not just a store, it's a
declaration. The idea is to offer

33
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,340
economic alternatives linked to the
recycling and repair of electronic

34
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,160
devices, as well as cultural workshops
for the community. I want to create a

35
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,160
space where what others discard, we
recover and give it a

36
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,040
-new life, a second chance.
-Hello, how are you? We invite you to this

37
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,780
next Thursday, thirty-eighth of... of
March,

38
02:00:59,780 --> 00:03:00,920
um,

39
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,360
HUBLab Laboratory,

40
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:11,100
to take a-- a kind of workshop, a kind
of course, the

41
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,880
training so you can make a

42
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:32,040
[electric guitar and trumpet music]
