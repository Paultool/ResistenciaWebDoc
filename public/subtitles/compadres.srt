1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:03,999
-Background music.
-What's up, "compadres" of the world,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,980
"compadres"?

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:06,939
Tonight

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,579
we will see

5
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:13,519
a special program

6
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:18,159
for you, "compadres,"

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,680
because to be a "compadre"

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:22,920
you have to be

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,059
very

10
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:25,719
cool/a great dad.

11
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:28,260
And if you're not a dad.

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:36,759
Damn. The moment of the "compadres'"
departure.

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,700
Background music. Does it sometimes feel
like the whole world is against

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,619
you? And

15
01:19:900 --> 01:20:159
how could

16
01:20:159 --> 01:35,479
you

17
01:35:479 --> 01:40,019
win against others? Isn't that right? Or
maybe not? Or maybe not?
