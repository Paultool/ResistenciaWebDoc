00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.780
-Friends.

2
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.090
-Hello? We are

3
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.740
back. Back. I am

4
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.900
-Rigo.
-Rigo Rosas.

5
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.740
-Rigoberto Rosas.
-And I am your dear friend Rento.

6
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.659
Rento Nogart.

7
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.180
We are here to make a very special announcement.

8
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.650
Well, soon, very soon. My life began to transform long before I got

9
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.820
here. I lived in an apartment in Narvarte with Sonia. After years of

10
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.220
arguments, of attempts, I understood that it was not a place to stay. Not just the

11
00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:00.440
physical place, but the place in my life. The walls did not give us peace. That's when I

12
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.640
realized that houses sometimes get destroyed as much as oneself.

13
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.920
The routine as an engineer was dragging me down, until one day in Parque México I saw

14
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.400
my father

15
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.320
marching, lost amidst the chaos of the city, searching for food in a garbage dump,

16
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.040
as if he had always been a part of it. I invited him to my house, he rejected me.

17
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.160
I gave him money to eat something. It was a strange encounter, but also a

18
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.780
reunion with something I never understood.

19
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.520
Hello, friends! My name is Tom Melón.

20
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.240
You might remember me

21
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.679
because I used to advertise Juanita Bananas, years ago. But now I've been

22
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.350
fired and I have a cooking show. Alright, friends.

23
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.300
Things with Sonia didn't work out. The city, the routine, the job, overwhelmed

24
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.480
me. That's when art and noise saved me. I formed Lechones Sangrientos (Bloody Piglets) with Rolando

25
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.720
and later Conjunto Aleluya

26
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.900
(Hallelujah Ensemble) with Javier. Alcohol, music, and poetry were my refuge and form

27
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.359
of resistance. But something deeper was still missing.

28
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.500
Hehe, buddies, how are you? I'm your friend Tom Melón

30
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.760
and today

31
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.780
I have traveled a few miles away from home

32
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.500
to show you

33
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.020
how to make some dishes

34
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.880
that are a bit

35
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.280
doughy, a bit greasy, and with lots of salt. We are in the beautiful city of Paris.

36
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.930
You can see it.

37
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.579
-Look at the tower, look at the sun.
-With my savings I traveled to Europe to play

38
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.700
noise, seeking answers with my screams. In Lyon, I met my cousin Viviane.

39
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.980
I understood how far I was from what I really wanted. I returned with a new

40
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.620
perspective. I quit my engineering job and art became my

41
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.460
life. I started recording music, creating chaos and sound, seeking solace in the noise,

42
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.500
something that never came. Then I dedicated myself to film. One day, like a mystery

43
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.020
movie, after years, I ran into my father again. We saw each other more

44
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.320
often and one day I asked him if he could ever have a house. He looked at me and said

45
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.160
no. That answer shook me, but it gave me clarity about what I never understood about

46
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.720
him. The city, meanwhile, continued erecting buildings, but my walls were

47
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.180
crumbling.
